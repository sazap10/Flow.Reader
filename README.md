=========== 
A group project created in Third Year of Computer Science.

## What is FlowReader?
FlowReader is a program written is JavaFX that reads in a .txt or .pdf file and displays them in two different views: Dive View and Flow View.

The Dive View displays word clouds representing different levels of abstraction of the input. The user can choose to dive into different sections of the book.

The Flow View displays the pages within the given input file alongside with the word clouds. As the user zooms in, the word clouds changes accordingly to provide a more specific representation for that zoom level.

##Why use FlowReader?
FlowReader presents a new way of reading. It allows the reader to quickly grasp the ideas within the given text. Isn't it nice to know what you're getting into before getting into it?
